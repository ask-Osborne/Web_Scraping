# Web Scraping Showcase with Python

This Python script demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library. The target for this project is the Wikipedia page for the 2022â€“23 Premier League. The goal is to extract relevant information from a specific table on the page.

# Script Explanation
The script uses `requests` to fetch the HTML content of the Wikipedia page.
`BeautifulSoup` is then employed to parse the HTML and navigate the document's structure.
The specific table of interest is located using the `find_all('table')[2]` method.
The table's rows and columns are extracted and processed to create a Pandas DataFrame.
The resulting DataFrame is saved as a CSV file.

# Showcase Highlights
- **Web Scraping Technique:** Utilizing `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML and navigating the document structure.
- **Data Extraction:** Focusing on a specific table on the Wikipedia page to showcase targeted information extraction.
- **Script Organization:** A well-organized Python script with clear comments and explanations.
